"text" : "April arrives, and suddenly I’m back to being a junior developer—not because of code, but taxes.\n\nYou know the drill: you’ve shipped features, debugged systems, and refactored production issues… yet when it comes to filing your ITR, you're stumped.\n\nThe portal glitches, the forms update, and those mysterious pre-filled entries?\n\nNobody explained what they meant—or why they mattered. Meanwhile, your CA quotes a steep fee or involves multiple back-and-forth rounds, and you're left trusting numbers you don't fully understand.\n\nThis time, I treated my ITR filing like a production issue and I found Prosperr.io.\n\nTheir AI-powered approach was like finding the optimal solution:\n\n✅ Reduced tax liability to ₹8.5 Lakhs (found the bug in my CA's logic)\n✅ Execution time for ITR filing: 1 week vs 4 weeks\n✅ Error rate: 0% vs my CA's multiple back-and-forth\n\nThe result?\n\nUsed saved money to upgrade my entire dev setup and to invest in upskilling my financial knowledge.\n\nHere's what I learned:\n\nWe solve complex distributed systems daily but accept 'taxes are hard' as final answer.\n\nWe debug production issues in minutes but let CAs run inefficient tax algorithms on our money. We optimize for performance everywhere except our own finances.\n\nIt’s high time now to apply a competitive programming mindset to your taxes as well.\n\n🔥 Exclusive for my coding network: 30% OFF Prosperr.io's Super Saver Plan - https://lnkd.in/g-4_7rgU\n\n• Built for engineers who demand efficiency\n• AI-powered optimization with expert CA’s (finally!)\n• FREE assessment call\n\nLink in comments as well👇\n\nhashtag#RSU hashtag#ESPP hashtag#TechTaxes hashtag#SoftwareEngineers hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#CompetitiveProgramming hashtag#TaxOptimization hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#Prosperrio",

I’m not using bots or spammy hacks.\nJust a much (MUCH MUCH) tighter process.\n\nBecause most creators are burnt out.\n\n- They write 'Hey there 👋' 27 times a day\n- They scroll through 15 profiles hoping 1 is a fit\n- They comment to stay relevant (but sound like a robot)\n\nIt’s soul-sucking. And it doesn’t work fyi.\n\nIn 2024, I knew I couldn’t keep up with this bs.\nEvery day felt like a literal sprint to be seen.\n\nBut still...no leads. So I rebuilt everything.\n\nHere's how I now get leads in <10 minutes/day:\n\n↓\n\n1. Pre-qualified lead validation\n↳ AI tells me who’s a fit before I waste time\n\n2. Pre-written comment/content bank\n↳ 20+ warm comments + content that don’t sound AI\n\n3. Quality DM scripts (well researched ones)\n↳ So I can start conversations without being ignored\n\nThis isn’t lead gen. It’s systemised visibility.\n\nThat actually leads to deals.\n\nP.S. You doing random outreach every day? Or are you doing what actually gets replies? I just helped book my client 2 calls in their FIRST week of outreach using this system.

Has pretty much dried up\n- The ‘I post and get leads’ pipeline?
